## Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

For this project we read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and we then performed an analysis on the data, and the result was to output a tidy data set.

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script:
	* `features.txt`
	* `subject_train.txt`
	* `subject_test.txt`
	* `X_train.txt`
	* `X_test.txt`
	* `y_train.txt`
	* `y_test.txt`

**Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.txt](tidy.txt).**

More info can be found in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
